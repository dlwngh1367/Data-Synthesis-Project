#Data-Synthesis-Project

Developed a Python-based data management system with three layers: Model, Business, and Presentation.
When the user runs the program, there are many options. There are options to load data from the csv file, to select and display specific data,
to add data to the csv file, to modify data, to delete data, to display the horizontal bar chart based on the csv file using 3rd party libraries, and so on.
The Model Layer includes a versatile Record class and a hierarchy of RecordFormatter for customized formatting.
The Business Layer, represented by the DataManager class, facilitates data operations such as loading, saving, and manipulation of records.
The Presentation Layer offers a command-line interface with menu-driven options, including record creation, editing, deletion, and visualization through horizontal bar charts.
Implemented unit tests using unittest to ensure functionality and data integrity.
